# livepeer-nft

## Purpose

This guide will walk users through uploading and minting a video as an NFT using [Livepeer](https://livepeer.com/), a decentralized video transcoding platform that has a [streaming](https://livepeer.com/docs/api-reference/stream/overview) and [video on demand API](https://livepeer.com/docs/api-reference/vod/upload). 

### Prerequisites: 
- Have node installed on your machine.
- Have a .mp4 video on your machine to upload.
- Have a metamask wallet and Metamask broswer extension.
- Be connected to the Polygon network.
- Have MATIC or test MATIC in your Metamask wallet.

### Upload Your Video
1. Get an API key for Livepeer [here](livepeer.com/dashboard/developers/api-keys). 
2. Head to the directory where your video is stored - I'd suggest Desktop for east. 
3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the Livepeer CLI: ```npm install -g @livepeer/video-nft```
4. Run the following command in your terminal: ```video-nft```
5. Enter your Livepeer API key from step 1
6. Type in the name of the .mp4 you want to upload
7. Name your NFT.
8. Optionally customize the metadata for your video NFT by hitting ```Y``` when prompted
9. Once your video has successfully been uploaded you will get an object with fields, including your IPFS hash containing your metadata:

```json
{
  "videoFileCid": "Qmbo4CREdbLDTFEd3UFo4byTfes6YoN9CvBwSrMhnDqcpZ",
  "nftMetadataCid": "QmXLQqt5zztHNj3ByvvopC7xbhNrdNPDutJQJvaoSBJ9eQ",
  "videoFileUrl": "ipfs://Qmbo4CREdbLDTFEd3UFo4byTfes6YoN9CvBwSrMhnDqcpZ",
  "videoFileGatewayUrl": "https://ipfs.livepeer.com/ipfs/Qmbo4CREdbLDTFEd3UFo4byTfes6YoN9CvBwSrMhnDqcpZ",
  "nftMetadataUrl": "ipfs://QmXLQqt5zztHNj3ByvvopC7xbhNrdNPDutJQJvaoSBJ9eQ",
  "nftMetadataGatewayUrl": "https://ipfs.livepeer.com/ipfs/QmXLQqt5zztHNj3ByvvopC7xbhNrdNPDutJQJvaoSBJ9eQ"
}
```
